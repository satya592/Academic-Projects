Default answer fields, and the answer field inteface IAnswerField. Answer fields
are what make Ingatan so flexibile. They are context aware components that
can be provided with correct answers and a marking scheme during design time,
and embedded into the design text area. They then take input from the user at
quiz time, return a result, and display the correct answer. Custom answer fields
can be created and imported.
